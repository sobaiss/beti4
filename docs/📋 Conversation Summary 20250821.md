Conversation Summary
We've been focusing on enhancing the UI/UX of your Beti platform, specifically for user authentication and account management.

Here's a quick overview of our progress:

UI Refactoring: We've significantly improved the visual design of the registration pages (general, agency-specific) and the user account page (/mon-compte/page.tsx), incorporating modern aesthetics like gradients, glass morphism, and better component styling.
Image Upload: A key feature added to the user account page is the ability for users to upload their profile pictures, with the image being sent as a base64 string to your API.
Error Resolution: We've also addressed and fixed several technical errors encountered during these UI refactoring processes, ensuring the components function correctly.
